# This file contains commonly used functions to access ACS data with the tidycensus and acs packges.
# The functions import and manipulate ACS data.
#
# All function names should start with 'ff' so that when code is reviewed it is clear that the 
# functon was custom built.

# This function loads all acs variable names. It supplies parameters and values to other functions,
# and will not be called within R scripts
var_names16 <- load_variables(2016, "acs1")

########### Import data  ###########

# The following functions import data into ACS
# The only function that needs to be run in R scripts is 'ff_import_acs'
# The general framework is as follows:
#     tidycensus essentially only allows users to import one geographic unit, one year, and one table
#     at a time. These three tasks are broken down into three different functions. Then, the function
#     'ff_import_acs' combines these three functions, so that multiple tables, geographic units, and
#     years can be imported with one function call.
#
# Important Note: All data imports with a 95% confidence level of the MOE
# This differs from ACS fact finder, which shows the 90% confidence level


# The following function creates a vector of table names for all tables within a group.
# For example, entering the parameter 'B20017' returns B20017, B20017A, B20017B, etc.
# This function add table and variable descriptions to the data, for ease of understanding

           label = str_replace_all(.$label, '!!', '\n'))
  
  # remove variables from table names; this leaves us with the different tables
  # the varible names are after the '_'; therefore use regular expressions to remove characters after '_';
  # then store the distinct table names in a vector
