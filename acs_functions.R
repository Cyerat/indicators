########### Import data  ###########

# The following functions import data into ACS
# The only function that needs to be run in R scripts is 'ff_import_acs_county'
# The general framework is as follows:
#     tidycensus essentially only allows users to import one geographic unit, one year, and one table
#     at a time. These three tasks are broken down into three different functions. Then, the function
#     'ff_import_acs_county' combines these three functions, so that multiple tables, geographic units, and
#     years can be imported with one function call.
#
# Important Note: All data imports with a 95% confidence level of the MOE
# This differs from ACS fact finder, which shows the 90% confidence level
