#
# Import ACS data.
#
# The following functions import data into ACS using teh census API and tidycensus package.
# The only function that needs to be run in R scripts is 'ff_import_acs' (the final function)
# The general framework is as follows:
#     tidycensus essentially only allows users to import one geographic unit, one year, and one table
#     at a time. These three tasks are broken down into three different functions: 
#     
#       ff_import_tables returns all tables for a specific geographic unit and year
#    
#       ff_import_years calls ff_inport_tables and returns the tables created by ff_import_tables for 
#       a series of years
#
#       ff_import_acs then calls ff_import_years and returns all tables for multiple counties for all
#       the years created by ff_import_years
#
# The final result is that ff_import_acs can be used to return tables for multiple years and geographic units
#
# Important Note: All data imports with a 95% confidence level of the MOE
# This differs from ACS fact finder, which shows the 90% confidence level
